## Q&A

#### Who Are You?
I hope this project helps answers that question for me, go explore the project!

#### Isn't Ember Overkill for a CV?
Yes, it is. I created this app using Ember-CLI to emphasize different programming skills
including:
- Using Ember
- Creating components
- CI/CD practices
- Testing

#### Why Ember?
Because I really like Ember but I could have made it just as easily in ReactJS or plain old HTML

#### No, Really, Why Ember
I chose ember because it has a ecosystem of rich addons and a app structure that fits very well
with my programming style.

#### Can I Use This as a Template?
Sure, why not. Just be sure to let people know where you got it from
