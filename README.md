## Q&A

#### Who Are You?
I hope this project helps answers that question for me. Now, go explore the project!

#### Tomoguisuru?
Tomoguisuru is Japanese and means "to eat one's own kind" or simply cannibalism.
 
#### Really? But Why?
Yep, really. I had an instructor in the MTC tell a story that when something like this.

    When he was in Japan visiting a man and his wife at dinner time. The man invited
    him to sit down and enjoy the meal, Pork Ramen. When the mans' wife took a bite 
    of the pork the member began yelling "TOMOGUISURU!" over and over again. My 
    instructor didn't recognize the word as one he'd heard before so he looked it up 
    in his Japanese-to-English dictionary. 
    
    Tomoguisuru: "to eat one's own kind"
    
    He realized that the man was calling his wife a "pig" and that the man should 
    probably sleep with one eye open from that day on.

The story made me laugh so hard that I'll never forget it.

#### Isn't Ember Overkill for a CV?
Yes, it is. I created this app using Ember-CLI to emphasize different programming skills
including:
- Using Ember
- Creating components
- CI/CD practices
- Testing

#### Why Ember?
Because I really like Ember but I could have made it just as easily in ReactJS or plain old HTML

#### No, Really, Why Ember
I chose ember because it has a ecosystem of rich addons and a app structure that fits very well
with my programming style.

#### Can I Use This as a Template?
Sure, why not. Just be sure to let people know where you got it from
